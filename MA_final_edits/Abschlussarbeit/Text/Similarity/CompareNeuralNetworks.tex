Statistical shape analysis \cite{small_statistical_2012} is used in a field of research area to develop similarity that correspond to the axioms of valid metrics \cite{boix_gulp_nodate, shahbazi_riemann_manif, williams_generalized_2021}. 
Some theoretical assurances are provided by learning within suitable metric spaces \cite{baraty_impact_2011, chang_clust_met_space, dasgupta_performance_2005, wang_survey_dist_metr, williams_generalized_2021}. 
For instance, by altering current dissimilarity measures to make sure they satisfy metric requirements, Williams et al. [42] generate two families of generalized form metrics. 
It is noteworthy that one of these generalized shape metrics, which is calculated for encoder maps is based on linear regression over the group of linear isometries.
