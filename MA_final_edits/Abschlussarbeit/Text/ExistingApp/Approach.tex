This chapter is used to introduce the existing approach.
As we already introduced in chapter \ref{NLP} language encoder and the preliminaries \ref{Preliminaries} on Metric Spaces, Norms, Distances and Homotopie.
We first explain, how to use homotopy, to measure similarity of language encoder, that are task independent.
That is, if we only consider a pretrained model, without an specific downstream task.
Therefore, a method called \textbf{intrinsic homotopy} is used.
Secondly, we consider the similarity measure of language encoder performing on a downstream task, using \textbf{extrinsic homotopy}.
Finally, we will consider how the notion of similarity can be approximated in practice.
